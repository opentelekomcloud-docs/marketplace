Purchase and Deploy a Product Offering
--------------------------------------

In Marketplace you would find all sorts of product which are available to deploy or subscribe. Those applications that need to be deployed, need an Environment to use as the destination. For instance, if you want to deploy a Product of type CCE then you need to have a CCE cluster up and running before trying to deploy them. For products that requires subscription then for using it you do not need any environment to be prepared in advanced (although you need to have an application that use the service of them, no deployment would happen after subscription when you configure it using Marketplace).

CCE Open Source, Free or Trial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These types of products are CCE. This means that for using them you need to have an up and running CCE cluster before trying to use them. Your CCE cluster is supposed to have enough resource to allow the deployment. We recommend having an updated version of CCE to be used. As the name suggests, these products are weather Open Source or free of charge. Which means customer would not be charged to use them.

When you select those products then as shown in the picture you would see wealth of information such as the type and license or even the detailed data such as the technology and software that has been used to build this product.

.. image:: /_static/images/image25.jpg
   :width: 6.53169in
   :height: 4.95833in

To try this kind of product you need to click on configure to deploy that on your CCE. There you should first select the destination CCE that needs to be chosen for deployment. You can select any project of your OTC tenant where your CCE cluster is available.

.. image:: /_static/images/image26.jpg
   :width: 6.53178in
   :height: 5.65903in

Then you can pick up the CCE cluster in that project as the destination. Finally, you can weather select the already available namespace or ask to pick up a new namespace to deploy.

Next step would be to fill information that has been prepared for customizations of deployment. For instance, as you can see below, there are couple of configurations that needs to be filled for this deployment such as the Storage Class for creating the disk or the credentials that this application requires for user to be able to login to.

Eventually after filling all the information which are needed for this deployment, you would click on “Deploy now” to deploy that application.

A message would let you know that the deployment has been started. As some deployments needs some time to finish it may take around 2~5 minutes for that to finish.

Meanwhile, you can see the manifests of that product in the namespace of your CCE. In addition, the record of your deployment would also be available in the “workload” dashboard.

Please be aware that tenant owner is supposed to pay for the services that he/she has deployed in his/her tenant. This means that for instance if the product required to have a permanent disk to be created for it to store information, then although the product is free of charge, customer is supposed to pay for price of provisioned disk.

CCE BYOL
